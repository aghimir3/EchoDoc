# EchoDoc

## üöÄ Introduction
EchoDoc is an **AI-powered document processing and job management dashboard** designed for developers and LLMOps professionals. It enables users to create **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models**, **Fine-Tuned models**, and **RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning) models** with ease. Whether you are handling **fine-tuning jobs**, **managing document processing workflows**, or **interacting with AI models**, EchoDoc provides a streamlined experience with an intuitive API and real-time UI updates. **A model can be deployed instantly after uploading the relevant files, allowing for seamless integration and rapid iteration.**

## Features

### üìå User Interface (UI)
- **üöÄ Job Management**
  - View job details, including status, completion time, and file count.
  - Monitor fine-tuning progress and execute fine-tuning as needed.
  - Open job logs in a modal for debugging.

- **üíÇ File Upload System**
  - Upload multiple files under a specified job name.
  - Receive real-time status updates during the upload process.
  - Error messages for missing fields or failed uploads.

- **üí¨ Chat Interface**
  - Chat with AI models after job completion.
  - Supports different modes: **RAG**, **RAFT**, and **Fine-Tuned**.
  - Uses `marked.js` for Markdown rendering.

- **‚ö° Real-Time UI Updates**
  - Job cards dynamically update based on API responses.
  - Displays spinners and status indicators for better UX.
  - Error messages are provided for API failures.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics
EchoDoc includes a **robust evaluation framework** for assessing fine-tuned and retrieval-augmented models. The evaluation process includes:

- **Relevancy:** Measures how well the response aligns with the query.
- **Faithfulness:** Checks for hallucinations or inaccurate claims.
- **Completeness:** Ensures all necessary details are covered.
- **Clarity:** Evaluates how well-structured and understandable the response is.
- **Correctness:** Assesses factual accuracy.
- **Oracle Agreement:** Compares the response with a ground-truth reference.

This framework helps ensure high-quality AI outputs for **RAG, RAFT, and fine-tuned models**.

## üîó API Endpoints
The FastAPI backend provides the following RESTful API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/chat/job/{jobId}` | POST | Sends user messages to AI models and retrieves responses |
| `/api/evaluate/job/{jobId}` | POST | Evaluates a fine-tuned model for a job |
| `/api/finetune/job` | POST | Initiates fine-tuning for a job |
| `/api/finetune/job-with-model` | POST | Fine-tunes a job using a specific model |
| `/api/finetune/status/{jobId}` | GET | Fetches the fine-tuning status of a job |
| `/api/logs/{jobId}` | GET | Retrieves logs for a given job |
| `/api/jobs` | GET | Fetches a list of document processing jobs |
| `/api/upload` | POST | Handles file uploads |

### Standardized API Response Format
All API responses follow the `APIResponse` model:
```python
class APIResponse(BaseModel):
    data: Optional[Any] = None
    errorMessage: Optional[str] = ""
    success: bool = True
    errors: List[str] = []
```
#### Sample JSON Response:
```json
{
  "data": { "jobId": 123, "status": "completed" },
  "errorMessage": "",
  "success": true,
  "errors": []
}
```

### üìÉ Viewing API Documentation (Swagger UI)
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:
- Open **Swagger UI**:
  ```
  http://localhost:8000/docs
  ```
- Open **ReDoc**:
  ```
  http://localhost:8000/redoc
  ```

  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
  DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
  DEFAULT_FINETUNE_MODEL=gpt-4o-2024-08-06
  LOCAL_STORAGE_FOLDER=local_storage
  FAISS_SUBFOLDER=faiss
  ```
